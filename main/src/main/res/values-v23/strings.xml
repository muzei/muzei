    <string name="source_warning_message">There are known issues with Legacy Sources on your device.
        You must disable Battery Optimizations on any Legacy Source you select to ensure it can
        load wallpapers. This may cause additional battery drain.\n\n
        In addition, Legacy Sources load on their own schedule and don\'t use Auto Advance.
        This may lead to additional data usage if the Legacy Source does not have its own WiFi
        only setting.\n\n
        Support for Legacy Sources will be removed in early 2019 due to Google Play Store
        targetSdkVersion requirements.</string>
